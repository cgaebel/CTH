Permission is hereby granted for you to use this code for anything you
want. This includes all code, binaries, libraries, obituaries, and the
attached license. There is only one stipend. If you use this code to
take over the world, I want the state of California. Seriously. If this
code appears ANYWHERE in a "taking over the world" program, you are legally
bound to give me that state. If you like this, and we ever meet, you're
more than welcome to buy me a beer (or coffee if I'm under age).
